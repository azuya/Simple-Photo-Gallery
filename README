SIGAL: Simple Image GALlery v 0.1
---------------------------------

!!! Not working yet. Working release set for 2010-11-01.
(!) From version 0.1 to 1.0, there will be a lot of breaks in backward compatibility. Please keep this in mind.

An adaption of the simple-photo-gallery for Kohana 3.0.x
For better incorporation in your own website, it no longer uses a template view or any javascript.
Modules it depends on:
 * Image
 * (Cache?)
 * an ORM-module (in v0.1 only the Kohana ORM Models are included, but they can be extended for others...)
 * an Auth-module (in v0.1 only the Kohana Auth module is included, but it can be extended for others...)

Please refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
