SIGAL: Simple Image GALlery v 0.1
---------------------------------

This is a very simple image gallery for Kohana 3.0.x
It is based upon the simple-photo-gallery for Kohana 2.3.4 / 2.4
For better incorporation in your own website, it no longer uses a template view or any javascript.
Modules it depends on:
 * Image
 * (Cache?)
 * an ORM-module (in v0.1 only the Kohana ORM Models are included, but they can be extended for others...)
 * an Auth-module (in v0.1 only the Kohana Auth module is included, but it can be extended for others...)

Please refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
